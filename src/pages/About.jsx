      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>PraktiFind</strong> â€“ a platform designed to help students and graduates find
        practical training and internship opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was created during our university practical training to solve a common problem:
        many students struggle to get reliable placements for field training and internships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to connect students and fresh graduates with companies, institutions, and
        organizations that offer real-world experience aligned with their career goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        PraktiFind provides a simple way to search, apply, and keep track of available opportunities.
        We aim to support youth in building skills, gaining confidence, and preparing for the job market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a student, graduate, or organization, you're welcome to be part of this mission.
